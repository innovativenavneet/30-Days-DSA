## 🚀 1. Introduction

Welcome to your **personal 100-day DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) preparation sprint**!  
This repository is your guide and tracker for a focused journey to master the core CS concepts essential for technical interviews and robust software development.

> **📅 Starting Date:** 26th July 2025

---

## 🎯 2. Goal

The primary goal is to build a **deep understanding** of fundamental data structures, algorithm patterns, and problem-solving techniques.

By Day 100, you should be able to:

- ✅ Choose the most suitable data structure for a given problem
- ✅ Analyze time & space complexity
- ✅ Implement core algorithms from scratch
- ✅ Decompose complex problems into subproblems
- ✅ Communicate your thought process effectively

---

## ⏱️ 3. Duration

A **100-day streak** of learning and solving problems.

> **Consistency over intensity.** Every single day counts.

---

## 💡 4. Methodology

### 📘 Conceptual Understanding

Spend time learning **theory**, drawing diagrams, and understanding properties.

### 🧩 Pattern Recognition

Identify recurring **problem patterns** like:

- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- BFS/DFS
- DP Memoization

### 🧠 Problem Solving

Practice structured problems on platforms like LeetCode.

### 🔍 Review & Refactor

Learn from optimal solutions. Revisit and **refactor** your code.

### 🔁 Spaced Repetition

Reinforce old concepts **regularly**.

---

## 🗓️ 5. Daily Structure

> Minimum **2-3 hours/day** recommended

| Time       | Activity                                            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| 30–45 mins | Learn or review a new concept                       |
| 60–90 mins | Solve 2–3 related problems (Easy → Medium → Hard)   |
| 30–45 mins | Analyze, refactor, revise previously learned topics |
